<p>re:invent, which is gonna gather professionals from
all over the world, is definitely going to be a great
source of inspiration for our systems, and we&rsquo;re
very happy to have someone who will be able
to get a closer look at best practices, processes
and tools in the industry; to learn from the community
and the industry leaders is something we value very
much, here at Namshi.</p>

<p>Never heard of re:invent before?</p>

<li>sessions spread over <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/sessions.html">20 topics</a></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re a geek somewhere around Boston, in September,
you definitely don&rsquo;t want to miss the
<a href="http://www.northeastphp.org/">PHP North East</a>
conference, which has an amazing lineup of
<a href="http://www.northeastphp.org/speakers">speakers</a>
and <a href="http://www.northeastphp.org/speakers/view/176/Alessandro-Cinelli">a surprise</a>
from Dubai.</p>

<p><img class="left <a" src="href="http://2014.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cirpo.jpeg">http://2014.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cirpo.jpeg</a>" width="250"></p>

<p>Among the plethora of <a href="http://www.northeastphp.org/agenda">interesting talks</a>
there will be a (definitely) fun one, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.northeastphp.org/talks/view/352/PHP-is-the-king-nodejs-is-the-prince-and-Lua-is-the-fool">PHP is the king, NodeJS the price and Lua
is the fool</a>&rdquo;
given by our <a href="http://tech.namshi.com/team/#Alessandro%20Cinelli%20(cirpo)">Cirpo</a> who will entertain the crowd with some
details on how we mesh a whole lot of languages and platforms
together.</p>

<p>Namshi&rsquo;s SOA is currently running on at least 4 different
application platforms and Cirpo took the opportunity to share some insights
about how we are doing it: it will be a <em>hands-on</em> talk focused on
decision-making, benefits and pitfalls of running such a heterogeneous
architecture and how crazy ideas (like flirting with Lua) could be a
game-changer in your next long-term project.</p>

<p>Cirpo is no newbie to the world of speaking, as he already delivered
a few talks in the past and, <a href="https://joind.in/user/view/956">judging by the ratings</a>,
has a track record of nothing but success. Being a leader, at Namshi, doesn&rsquo;t mean
to only set the tone for our team, but also to confront with the community,
explain (and validate) our infrastructure and learn from the feedbacks we get back:
Cirpo knows that very well and this will be a great experience from this
standpoint.</p>

<p>We wish him a safe trip to the U.S. and wish <strong>you</strong> can
attend his talk!</p>

<p>One week ago, Luciano, Lucio, Alex and I attended the annual <a href="http://jsday.it">jsDay</a> and <a href="http://phpday.it">phpDay</a> in Verona organized by the <a href="http://grusp.it">GrUSP</a>, the Italian PHP user Group.
It was a nice experience in the beautiful city of Verona, and an opportunity to meet interesting people from international communities while attending the talks during those 4 days.<br />
The conferences were sold out, with more than 300 attendees and two tracks per day. Kudos and props to the organizers!</p>

building our Service Oriented Architechture.</p>

<h2>Join communities!</h2>

<p>Attending conferences that are community driven like jsDay and phpDay
are always a great moment to improve yourself as a developer and they give you the possibility to be part of the community.
You have the chance to understand what’s going on in our field, talk in person with other devs that maybe you just know because you sent a PR to their awesome opensource project on Github, getting tons of advices and inspiration and so on.
Keep following <a href="http://twitter.com/technamshi">@TechNamshi</a> on twitter, a <strong>new community</strong> is coming in Dubai&hellip; <strong>stay tuned!</strong></p>

<p>Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/jsconfit">@jsday</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/phpday">@phpday</a> to stay updated on when they are going to release the talks videos.</p>
