    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just an heads up that we are looking for talented
engineers for our tech team, and our guys are very
sad they don&rsquo;t have too many new friends!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Besides looking for a Lead Mobile developer, as we
<a href="/blog/2014/06/03/like-android-and-ios-lets-change-shopping-in-the-middle-east-together/">announced a few weeks back</a>,
we are looking for some other key figures in our team.</p>

<h2>No HTML/CSS love&hellip;</h2>

<p>Our frontend team, usually happy to write AngularJS
directives or a bunch of frontend-ish NodeJS apps,
is devastated as they feel they are missing a third
element who can help them achieve greatness.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/frontend-sad.png"></p>

<p>To make Lucio and Shidhin happy, we want to add a new
member in our team, a <strong>Frontend Developer</strong>, someone who
is skilled on HTML5 and CSS3 and knows the basics of
JavaScript but wants to expand his knowledge in that
direction.</p>

<p>You will work on a whole lot of new internal applications
as well as help streamlining our frontend processes, together
with the rest of the team: which frameworks shall we use? Bootstrap or
Foundation? How can we use Yeoman&rsquo;s generator to speed up
most of our code generation? How can we make our web apps
faster <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/critical">extracting critical styles</a>
and so on? These are just a few questions you will need to
ask yourself once you come here.</p>

<p>You will come here knowing how to design a frontend (mastering
the presentation layer, so HTML, CSS, jQuery) but will leave Namshi
knowing how to build the presentation and logic behind a full
frontend application (AngularJS, Node or something more spicy
like <a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/">polymer</a>).</p>

<blockquote><p>Drop us an email at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#x77;&#111;&#x72;&#107;&#45;&#x69;&#x6e;&#45;&#x74;&#101;&#99;&#x68;&#x40;&#110;&#97;&#109;&#x73;&#104;&#x69;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#x77;&#x6f;&#114;&#x6b;&#45;&#x69;&#110;&#45;&#116;&#101;&#99;&#104;&#x40;&#x6e;&#97;&#x6d;&#115;&#104;&#x69;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;</a> to apply or simply
get more informations about this job opening!</p></blockquote>

<h2>Sitting on an empty (sysadmin) chair&hellip;</h2>

<p>Look at the systeam, so sad: they really
need some new buddy for their games.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/sys-sad.png"></p>

<p>The chair is empty, and that makes me so sad! If only
we could find someone who would like to come and join
the hottest SOA of the Middle East&hellip;</p>

<p>So yeah, we&rsquo;re also looking for a <strong>System Administrator</strong>,
someone who knows how configuration management works,
who has relevant experience on cloud infrastructures as
AWS and wants to use some of the latest technologies, like
Docker or Deis, to help us automate and scale the hell out
of our architecture; we are trying to switch towards a more
devops oriented organization, and need someone with that
mindset to improve the current state of the team: as an example,
we use <a href="http://serverspec.org/">serverspec</a> to test some of
our configurations, and would like someone who can get his/her
hands dirty with both programming and system administration
to help the team.</p>

<blockquote><p>Drop us an email at <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#119;&#x6f;&#114;&#107;&#x2d;&#105;&#x6e;&#x2d;&#x74;&#101;&#x63;&#x68;&#64;&#110;&#97;&#109;&#x73;&#104;&#x69;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#119;&#x6f;&#114;&#107;&#45;&#105;&#110;&#x2d;&#116;&#101;&#99;&#104;&#x40;&#110;&#x61;&#109;&#x73;&#x68;&#x69;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a> to apply or simply
get more informations about this job opening!</p></blockquote>

<h2>I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s crying because of loneliness or because of NodeJS&hellip;</h2>

<p>Look at how sad Cirpo, our lead API engineer, was
today:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/cirpo-sad.png"></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that he might be sad because we decided
to use a lot of NodeJS instead of PHP, but I
think his struggles also come from the fact that he feels
we need a good <strong>Senior Software engineer</strong>, specialized in
NodeJS, who can help the team getting more skilled with
this &ldquo;new&rdquo; platform.</p>

<p>The ideal candidate would have a few years of experience
on production-ready Node systems, and it would be a great
plus if we can get someone who has a broader experience
with different programming paradigms, as we feel the most
important part of this job is the brain, and it would be great
if we get someone that has been in a few different battlefields :)</p>

<p>We need someone who first solves the problem, then writes the
code (or, even better: first solves the problem, then writes the
test, then the code :-D).</p>

<blockquote><p>Drop us an email at <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#116;&#x6f;&#58;&#x77;&#111;&#x72;&#x6b;&#45;&#x69;&#x6e;&#x2d;&#x74;&#x65;&#x63;&#x68;&#x40;&#110;&#x61;&#x6d;&#115;&#x68;&#105;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;">&#119;&#x6f;&#x72;&#107;&#45;&#x69;&#110;&#x2d;&#x74;&#101;&#99;&#104;&#64;&#110;&#97;&#x6d;&#x73;&#x68;&#105;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;</a> to apply or simply

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Do you like Java? Ok, I possibly started from the wrongest question.</p>

<p>Restart.</p>

<p>Do you like Android? (sounds much better!) And what about iOS? Tablets?
Mobile devices in general? If so, come over and let&rsquo;s change the way
people shop in the Middle East.</p>

<p>We are looking for a <strong>Lead Mobile Developer</strong>, someone who can get his hands
dirty with both of the main platforms, and teach others how to do it: we&rsquo;d
like you to bring in your expertise and help kicking off our mobile
development team.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>What do we need?</h2>

<p>Our need is to kickoff an internal development team, which could even be split by
iOS and Android, and to do so we would need to make a first, very good hire and
find a lead who can drive all the way to success.</p>

<p>How will your typical day look like? You will go over a <a href="https://gist.github.com">gist</a> which has the specs for
a feature together with the other leads, wrap up a bugfix for the next release,
check one of the pull requests submitted by another team member and have
<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Shawarma_ad_Istanbul_(01.10.2008).JPG">lotsa shawarma</a> for lunch.</p>

<p>As general rules, we would like:</p>

<ul>
<li>someone who speaks both <strong>Android and iOS</strong> (if you know only one of them but think you deserve a position, talk to us and we&rsquo;d be very happy to hear your point)</li>
<li>a few years of proficient <strong>development of mobile applications</strong>, possibly being a leader of a small/mid-sized team</li>
<li>knowledge of the <strong>latest trend</strong> in your technical sector (you tell us if <a href="http://www.omgchrome.com/android-webview-auto-update-future/">android auto-updates its webview component</a>, not the other way round :) as well as suggesting tools like <a href="http://hockeyapp.net/features/">Hockey</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Object-Oriented design</strong>: sounds boring but we don&rsquo;t limit ourselves to MVC, we actually need you to <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/odino/dont-screw-it-up-how-to-build-durable-web-apis-phpday-2014-in-verona-ita">consume our APIs and get the most out of them</a></li>
<li>it would be a plus to get someone who is passionate about <strong>OSS</strong> and would like to release some of our stuff after polishing them for the public</li>
</ul>


<h2>What do we offer?</h2>

<ul>
<li>a good salary, we don&rsquo;t want to hire people who feel they&rsquo;ve been underpaid</li>
<li>SPDY, HTTP APIs and a Service-Oriented Architecture</li>
<li>a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/First+Gulf+Bank+Metro+Station+1+-+Sheikh+Zayed+Rd+-+Dubai+-+United+Arab+Emirates/More+Cafe+Gold+%26+Diamond+Park+-+Sheikh+Zayed+Rd+-+Dubai+-+United+Arab+Emirates/@25.1264065,55.2068206,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x3e5f6bc621973f29:0x18a89384f349bdf6!2m2!1d55.207756!2d25.126699!1m5!1m1!1s0x3e5f6bc6122edfe3:0x435be27ccd3d1564!2m2!1d55.208316!2d25.126114!3e2">1-minute-walk</a> from the metro to the office</li>
<li>a <a href="/team">great team</a></li>
<li>you <strong>will and won&rsquo;t</strong> be alone: our team is made of ~15 software engineers and we share best practices at the architectual / software design level,
but don&rsquo;t have a way to re-invent the current team members into mobile hackers</li>
<li>growth, as mobile is getting bigger and bigger (for us and for the ecommerce market in general): we expect the mobile
development team to be growing as months will go by</li>
<li>a company which is standing on the <a href="http://www.rocket-internet.de/">shoulder of giants</a></li>
<li>the <em>&ldquo;10th our breakpoint&rdquo;</em>: if you work for 10 hours then have a break, order food and we will reimburse it</li>
<li>working with <a href="http://instagram.com/p/gpSOCenpPI/">these two guys</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>So what?</h2>
